                      <p id="first_para">Hi, I want us to task our brains a little bit, and let's think of things we have done on our own, it could be house chores, social works, crafts, communication, relationship, teaching, reaching out,connecting people, hand work et cetera. You’ll realize that you’ve done a lot, which doesn’t even occur to you most times and it happens because you barely task your brain. But you are thinking over low paycheck or income, unemployment, over labor, broken relationship, stress and more. You end up blaming the government, your parents, your employer, your partner, fellow colleagues, schools and even friends. And as you keep doing it, the more you get inclined to it – because that’s the area you’re stressing you brain(mind) towards, the mind is a creative tool it functions as you want it to. What of if you take a break and consider thinking of the things you can do, especially the ones you have passion for, that you feel happy doing even if there is no reward. It helps builds your creative mind positively, and opens room for ideas. Ideas that will create a new world for you and that’s a part we must not keep away on our journey to success.</p> <p>Most times we don’t understand how powerful our thoughts are, our mind has the ability to bring to existence things that are conceived in it, it is very important to have great mindset, it’s a world changer, but it never ceases to work with action. Acting on your ideas is the greatest way to bring them to reality. Your ability to change your mindset opens door for action. Execution is a habit for a successful journey if really you want to create your own world, so that you don’t have to spend your years working for a little paychecks, or attaching blames for your statute. We all need a world of our own, to spend time with the ones we love, do the things we love doing, relate with people and communities we want to be in-touch with while maintaining a good and healthy life-style.</p>

                <div id="two" class="photoBox"><p>I know we all want to play safe to secure what we have for a future we don’t know, but the reality is we create our own future, being in your comfort zone will only get you subdued under a force that is holding your freedom. Take a thought, should in case a friend walks up to you happily telling he has a solution, your respond will be for what? That is to say if you can’t create problem they will be no solution, if you can’t quit that job that you don’t like, that job that is taken your time,that job that is stressing you up, how will start your own business? If you don’t identify what the problem is in the society, why things are the way they are,why are you working so hard and yet can’t meet up with your needs, how will you get it solved? Don’t be scared to stare up the pool, it’s a force that leads to change. Physics has a way of explaining this, especially when you are studying Force,Energy and Motion. If you don’t like Physics permit me, you’ll have to partake in a little bit of this lecture, let us look into Force. I love all its definition by Merriam Webster Children’s Dictionary, sometimes you have to break it down for easy comprehension, Kid’s Dictionary help me do it better, this are the various definition; “power that has an effect on something”, “the state of existing and being enforced”, “a group of people available for a particular purpose, ” power or violence used on a person or thing”, “an influence (as a push or pull) that tends to produce a change in speed or direction of motion of something”. It has more but I will stop here not to bore you with physics, the last definition is an ally and it’s self explanatory, you need influence(problem) that will push or pull you towards producing that change that will allow you create your own world, produce a change and direct your movement or motion.</p> 
                       <p>Bringing us to motion, the law of Inertia or Newton’s first law of motion states, ” an object stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force”. we shouldn’t see problems from the negative side, it’s a force the makes us act on our ideas and thoughts, another thing i like about the above law is that while in motion you need more problems to speed up or take a new direction. Problems aren’t made to scare us but to keep us motivated and to push us towards the right direction, people are scared of loosing that’s the reason why it’s hard for us to come out of our hidings and and challenge our situation. To fail means you tried something.</p><p>You are not looser when you fail, because it’s a step towards winning and you have learnt a way of not do something wrongly . We have to embrace failure and avoid being mediocre or docile of fear, in other to harness our full potentials we must accept either to loose or win, the worst is avoiding the battle field. It was the school system that made failure to be so scary, neglecting the fact you made a move before you failed, irrespective of the fact that our mind is the battle field, that is the most reason why you need to feed up your minds, your intellectual being needs to be healthy. To embrace creativity we all have to Man-Up, a battle lost is that which you never fought for. Giving up without a fight builds self hostility which leads to a reduction in self esteem, that is why we must build a habit to embrace loosing, and if you don’t loose you win. Victory does not come without a battle, sometimes we have to create problems to solve, because being lukewarm is poisonous to our creative minds, You have to shape yourself to be what you want to be, that is creating a world of your own.</p>

                    <h3>COMMUNICATION AND BUSINESS TODAY</h3>
                    <p>In in our everyday life some things are inevitable,one of such is communication, this is because they are characterized or are paramount to our day to day activities. This is also applicable to the business world, it’s absence or poor application can lead to poor results.</p> <p> Communication which is derived from the Latin word commūnicāre meaning “to share”, has been given various definitions, examples are; “the exchange of information between persons”, as stated in Marriam Webster Dictionary. According Business Dictionary; it’s a two-way process of reaching mutual understanding, in which participants not only exchange (encode-decode) information, news, ideas and feelings but also create and share meanings. In general, communication is a means of connecting people or places. In business, it is a key function of management–an organization cannot operate without communication between levels, departments and employees.</p> <p>It’s very important that Employers, Employees, Entrepreneurs, C.E.O’s, Organizations, Businesses, Customers and Individuals work on effective communication skills, because it does leave a gap that is very visible in terms of relationship, understanding, persuasion and loyalty if not well tackled. Good communication is a tool to project good image, about an organization or business, it goes a long way to help speak for and to maintain this image. That is to say it is inevitable for Public Relation purposes.</p> <p> I have been to organisations where good communications is the most important tool to sell their products and services and yet they mess around with this opportunities, examples of such organisation are banks in Nigeria, and the result leads to depreciation in the market. This problems shoul be combated, organisations and businesses irrespective of the size should make sure they brief their employees on communication skills, it drive sells and facilitates customer loyalty.</p> <p> Most of the problems of businesses today isn’t the product, rather inability to communicate and sell the image of their organisation to the public and anticipated customers. And it does affect their advertising strength and market penetration. The purpose of this write up is to urge businesses to understand the role communication in selling their products, building good customers service orientations and customer relationship that helps in persuading and creating customer loyalty.</p> <p> Proper orientation about this subject will enlighten our society and improve businesses within its environs, it should be an all go area for organisations to ensure that their staffs have a proper knowledge of it.</p> 
                    <p>Being a good communicator will help you loose nothing, but lacking in it can cost you a lot. </p> <b> Written by Princewill Nwokeke for (c)PNintouch</b>
